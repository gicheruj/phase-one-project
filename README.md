Project Description:
   In this project, I have built a website for a company that sells beauty products and travel accessories. I have used Html to create the layout of the page, css for adding some style to the page and Javascript to add some functionality. I have made the images clickable such that when the user wants to get more information about a product they can click on the product image. I have fetched the product info from a db.json file.
Technology used:
  Html, Css and JavaScript
